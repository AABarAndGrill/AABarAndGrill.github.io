    **Slim6**

    I found some time to update Slim6. Applied updates for 2017-08-01 security patch level. The Update will be available for following devices:

    - Galaxy Tab2
    - Galaxy Nexus
    - Oneplus One

    Source can be found [here](https://github.com/SlimRomsSecurity) in case you want to compile yourself.



    **Galaxy Tab2**

    - Added LineageOS 14.1, Omni7 and Slim7 sections

    Note that i am not using any Android 7 Roms myself on Galaxy Tab2. You can report bugs in the proper threads and maybe i look into it (maybe i don't - but hey, everything is OpenSource!).

    **OmniRom**

    First unified OmniRom 7.x build is up for Galaxy Nexus! Using old bootanimation because the new one is in stop-and-go mode, hope to solve the issue soon.


    **TWRP for Tuna - hardware encryption/decryption**

    Since Android 6 we ship hardware encryption on Galaxy Nexus. Currently official TWRP is not able to decrypt hardware encrypted tuna devices.
    [Ziyan](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2633638) started working on fixing it some time ago, but he is missing the time at the moment. [nailyk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6979267) , [_yen_](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2375847) and i are working on finishing what Ziyan started to get decryption support added to official TWRP in future.
    
    I have published working TWRP for maguro, toro and toroplus [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=73421863&postcount=2160) - please use them until we have support for hardware decryption on official TWRP.   


    **Galaxy Tab2**

    Thanks to some trolls on XDA i am not publishing any new Galaxy Tab2 Roms or Recoveries! I have said it thousand times before - stuff will be released if i feel it is ready and no one can force me to publish any N Roms! I am not your personal build bot!

    - I have a private life and do all this just for fun. 
    - I have a bad paied fulltime job, user or xda aren't paying my income and instead, if you are able to read, - donations are accepted but i welcome if those donations go to an organization who cares about (kids having) cancer (or similar).

    Maybe i'll publish something in the future - can't say yet. I am sorry for those who always followed the rules - but we reached a state i don't like to continue...


    **What else to say?**
    Have a nice weekend!

    **UPDATE**

    Reuploaded Omni 4.4 build for tuna.

    Also added device specific builds (device source matches official Omni trees, unified stuff can't be pushed because there's one commit missing in TWRP source on 4.4 to support it.)


    OmniRom 6 should be ready next days.


    **OmniRom**

    First unified OmniRom 4.4 build is up for Galaxy Nexus! I'll start looking again at OmniRom 6.0 next days.

    **OmniRom 4**
       
    OmniRom 4 updated! I have spend another whole day (>12 hours) to bring it up to 2017-07-01 security patch level. The Update will be available for Galaxy Tab2 (espressowifi & espresso3g).

    There's some extras added by default now which never made it's way into Omni 4 official:

    - All in One Animation Control
    - Battery Saver mode
    - On-The-Go mode
    - Implement App circle sidebar
    - follow dark 4.4 UI

    Those features have never been ready for official Omni, but people spend a lot of time writing those features and i really like those.

    Enjoy the build! (It will be online in the morning.)

    Slim7 Build 1.2 is available for Galaxy Nexus (tuna), deepsleep issues introduced in previous build should be solved.



    **Discontinued**
       
    IMO Android 5 was never a good running version for my devices and i'll stop all work on Android 5.
    I like to spend my little time on improving Android 4.4.4 and Android 6.0.1 based roms (also applying security Updates monthly).

    Discontinued Roms:

    - SlimLP
    - AOSP / UA 5.1
    - CM12.1 / LineageOS 12.1
    - OmniRom 5


    Discontinued devices:

    - Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini ("golden")

    Sorry, but at the moment i don't have the time to work on this devices.



    **Future plans**

    smart-t78@XDA-Developers and i started working on updating OmniRom 6 again (working our way up to July 2017 Security Patch Level. Maybe later we'll look again at OmniRom 4.
    OmniRom is one of my favourite - i'll post an update once there's some news.

    **General**

    After 6 Weeks i got my LG G4 back again... now waiting for the bootloop again (i am sure it will happen a 3rd time)... on vacation i never felt that bad using a phone like this time, running a backup of my photos every evening because i don't feel secure using that phone...

    I pushed some new AnyKernel for Galaxy Nexus and Tab2 Family which fix/workaround an security issue of LineageOS SU binary, besides that i am still not back to development.

    **Slim7**

    New Slim7 builds are up for Galaxy Nexus, had to test if latest translations compile fine - no device specific changes, only latest Slim7 Source + Translations.

    Hey together!

    Some of you might know already about the problems i currently have with my LG G4.
    My LG G4 was my daylie driver and i really need it because i am doing most stuff on my Phone.


    Just as an information for you, why i am not having much time for android at the moment - i am wasting time:

    - 01.02.2017: bootloop, lost all my data. I contaced LG and they repaired it in about 1 Week.
    - 01.04.2017: again bootloop, lost all my data again. I contaced LG how it can be the issue appears again. They told me they are sorry and i should talk to the shop where i bought the device in hope they replace it or refound me.
      I went to the shop and the owner told me that he needs to talk to LG again, he'll call me. 3 days later, no one called me back, i asked again how we can solve the problem. The shop owner told me LG said they need to send it to a repair center again.
    - 04.04.2017: shop takes the phone and send it to the repair center. I told him i need it back in 2 Weeks. He said i can't tell him a time he has to repair it - i am by law (ยง 439 BGB), but i don't have too (i would be stupid if i don't). He don't like to accept it, i had to send him an email once i am home saying the same again i told him already in the shop.
    - 18.04.2017 & 22.04.2017: asking the shop again - still in the repair center.
    - 26.04.2017: i visited the shop again - it is still in the repair center! (WTF?!) He'll contact LG and call me back - he never did.
    - 29.04.2017 & 02.05.2017: Asking about the status via email or if we can find a different solution (different phone?) - until today no answer.
    - 03.05.2017: I send him a letter saying he has to repair it until today (10. May), else he should give back the money.
    - 06.05.2017: You guys know, i am a friendly guy, i called him again asking if he's interested in finding a solution both of us can live with. I left a bad review on Facebook and on Google for his shop, he said he don't like to talk to me because of that.. i told him i'll update it if we find a proper solution. We talked a littlebit about what went wrong etc. and he finally decided to talk to LG and the repaircenter again. He'll call me back on Monady (8. May).
    - 08.05.2017: The shop called me (i never thought he did, but he did), the repair center is waiting for new mainboards and he asked me if i can give him some more time... i am a friendly guy, i said ok because i really liked the phone and would love to get it back.
    - In the meantime i talked to LG many times, they said they can't do anything, my G4 wasn't send to the LG repair center it must be in a different repair center (WTF?!).
    - 09.05.2017: I asked LG again if they can try to speed things up in the repair center, my G4 is there for almost 5 Weeks now. They said they need to know the repair center.
    - 10.05.2017: i visit the shop again, asking for the repair center. He don't like to tell the repair center...

    Looks like i have to wait for my G4 a little longer but i can't.... i need a good phone as my dd and really need a good smartphone camera because i use it often...

    **All my work on android is discontinued until my G4 is back or until i bought a new phone.**

    **General**
       
    Hey together! There have been some silent from my side, i spend a lot of time looking into android 7 for tab2 and tuna with success. It took some days until i got one major bug fixed: the device rebooted once it connected to wifi.

    I am forced now to take a break from android to look for a payed part time job to buy a new device which fits my needs.

    I currently own a LG G4 which is affected by the well known bootloop problem... It got repaired in February already, but after 2 weeks of use the issue was back and I lost all my personal data a second time. The G4 is still in the repair center, since 3 weeks... 
    Researching makes sure: the issue will never be fixed properly by LG and I will loose all my data again, sooner or later, once the device is back...
    Sad about it: the shop where i bought the G4 won't refund... they can't even tell me how long it takes to repair the device...

    **Absolutely no go and never ever LG again!**

    **Galaxy Tab2**
    
    Kernel Update

    - We re-enabled MMC_CAP_ERASE on our kernel source because of following reasons:
      - "moviNAND VHX 4.41 DISCARD feature" is (and always was) added to our kernel which should prevent MAG2GA eMMC (used on most 16GB Tab2 devices) from damage (official Samsung patch)
      - even with MMC_CAP_ERASE disabled some Tab2 with MAG2GA eMMC got read only (the reason is an issue in the eMMC firmware - besides MAG2GA eMMC is faulty/bad by default)
      - without TRIM emmc lifetime is shorter, it's now possible again on supported eMMC
    - Updated P51XX Touch Firmware

    What Roms include those changes?

    - all builds and recoveries since 24.09.2016

    **NOTE:** You might need to use TWRP 3.0.2-6 (uploaded already) to flash the new roms, on Android 4 and 6 old recoveries might work (but better update too).

    - Support eMMC 4.5. In the past our "new" kernel did not support eMMC 4.5 (some people seem to have newer EMMC). On TWRP it wasn't possible to wipe or flash any files on devices with newer EMMC.

    CM 13 update for espressowifi and espresso3g

    - Support eMMC 4.5. In the past our "new" kernel did not support eMMC 4.5 (some people seem to have newer EMMC) - that's why some people haven't been able to boot latest builds and got a black screen only.

    Notes about latest official CM11 nightly update

    - Clean flash might be required because of the following changes:
      - a lot of device specific updates (e.g. a lot of OpenSource blobs we already use on Android 5.1 and newer)
      - kernel source got replaced with our omap based OpenSource kernel (full change history, a lot debloated)
    - There might be a tiny delay between the Samsung logo and the bootanimation. This happens because we disabled the bootloader init (The bootloader init was disabled and the kernel resets everything on boot which is a good thing but delays bootup). Also your Tab 2 variant get detected by the kernel automatically (read out from bootloader).
    - If you have issues to boot your tab after a clean flash, you might need to update your bootloader. I'll provide the files and a tutorial sometimes later this week (maybe next week).

        (Our system partitions are relatively large (~1 GB), but our data partitions are relatively small (~4.6 GB on 8 GB variants).  
        In this case, it makes sense to enable WITH_DEXPREOPT_PIC, saving at least 100 MB space on our data partitions.)

    Note: Omni6 is official now! You can use official nightly builds now!

    Initial OmniRom 6.0.1 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g available

    - Latest official OmniRom source. Device specific changes are all visisble in OmniRoms device repos.
    - Currently sensor position isn't set properly on P31xx devices, but it will be fixed on upcoming builds.  
      A temporary fix can be found [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=67475381&postcount=8), you simply need to flash it after the Rom from TWRP.
    - Please note that OmniRom isn't pre-rooted!
    - Chromecast should still work on Omni 6.

    New CM 13.0 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g available

    - Latest CM 13.0 source
    - Attempt to fix hotspot
    - Ziyan fixed the random mac adress:  
      The Samsung BCMDHD used to read the factory MAC address from /efs. Accessing the filesystem in-kernel is a very bad practice, but what can we expect from Samsung?  
      We now calculate the MAC address based on the SoC Die ID: this is unique for all devices, and ensures that the same device will always have the same MAC address, not a randomly generated one.

    New CM 13.0 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g available

    - Latest CM 13.0 source
    - Clean flash recommand because we switched to our new kernel for a final public test before it finally replaces our old, bloated kernel.
    - **NOTE:** Booting takes some more time now - there's a delay for up to 10 sec. betweeen the samsung logo and bootanimation (The bootloader init was disabled and the kernel resets everything on boot which is a good thing but delays bootup.)
    - Many thanks to XDA's Ziyan for the new kernel! He did the main part of it! (We worked together on it for almost 9 months now - where is the time?!)
    - Kernel source will be available on CM's github after this public test to be sure everything works as it should - please respect that the source won't be public before
    - Found a bug? Attach a logcat and dmesg on XDA.

    - New kernel with last_kmsg support.  
      **NOTE:** Booting TWRP takes some more time now. The bootloader init was disabled and the kernel resets everything on boot which is a good thing but delays bootup.

    - New CM 13 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g uploaded, no device specific changes, only CyanogenMod upstream.  
      For changes please check [CyanogenMods Gerrit](http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/q/status:merged)

    - New SlimLP for S3 mini (i8190) uploaded, based on latest official Source, Global Menu added on top of it.  
      Videorecording still half broken, only works if you don't record Audio (you can use OpenCamera in that case).

    - Added my work on S3 mini (i8190) on this page too.

    Uploaded espresso-common TWRP 3.0.0-2 (updated recovery-kernel for proper last_kmsg support - makes debugging kernel issues much easier).

    I also uploaded some new kernel for latest CM 13 espressowifi and espresso3g builds - please test if you have time! [More information about it here on XDA.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=66084616&postcount=711)

    CM 12.1 & Omni 5.1 builds and common TWRP are reuploaded (I missed to add a kernel change). Previous 23.03. builds have been removed so you can't download the wrong files anymore.

    **CM 12.1 & Omni 5.1 builds and common TWRP will be reuploaded (I missed to add a kernel change). Current 23.03. builds have been removed. Fixed 23.03. builds and a fixed Common TWRP will be available soon (uploading already).**

    New CM 13 builds available.

    Missed to add "espresso: fade off by default: This fixes orientation glitch on screen-off animation for 7 inch Tab2" - will be fixed on next build.

    - libsensors: fix possible null pointer crash
    - espresso: set hwrotation on init for 7 inch Tab2 variants
    - some updates on kernel commonisation (might fix charging on P5113).

    Those Tab2 user who are on "espresso-TWRP" please flash the latest device specific TWRP for your device or use the new Common TWRP to flash latest Roms.

    - the "espresso-TWRP" won't be able to flash Roms compiled after 22.03.2016,
    - the new "Common TWRP" won't be able to flash Roms compiled before 22.03.2017.
    I am sorry if it confuses some of you, but as i mentioned on 22.03.2016 we would conflict with HTC's "espresso" device if we don't do the renaming.

    CM 12.1 & Omni 5.1 builds have been updated:

    - libsensors: fix possible null pointer crash
    - espresso: fade off by default: This fixes orientation glitch on screen-off animation for 7 inch Tab2.
    - espresso: set hwrotation on init for 7 inch Tab2 variants

    To avoid conflicts with with HTC's myTouch 3G Slide T-Mobile ("espresso") all upcoming unified builds for GT-P3110, GT-P3113, GT-P5110 and GT-P5113 will be called "espressowifi" instead "espresso".
