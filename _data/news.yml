    Hey together! There have been some silent from my side, i spend a lot of time looking into android 7 for tab2 and tuna with success. It took some days until i got one major bug fixed: the device rebooted once it connected to wifi.

    I am forced now to take a break from android to look for a payed part time job to buy a new device which fits my needs.

    I currently own a LG G4 which is affected by the well known bootloop problem... It got repaired in February already, but after 2 weeks of use the issue was back and I lost all my personal data a second time. The G4 is still in the repair center, since 3 weeks... 
    Researching makes sure: the issue will never be fixed properly by LG and I will loose all my data again, sooner or later, once the device is back...
    Sad about it: the shop where i bought the G4 won't refund... they can't even tell me how long it takes to repair the device...

    **Absolutely no go and never ever LG again!**

    Some of you noticed that i am not quite active at the moment. No, i haven't sold my devices, but private life counts more atm and i have a lot of other stuff to do because i am moving. Hopefully from february i'll be more active again. I hope all of you had a good start into 2017!

    CyanogenMod is discontinued, i guess all of you noticed the rebranding to LineageOS (at the end user should only notice the name change).
    
    Unoffical LineageOS testbuilds for espresso3g and espressowifi might be up sometimes this week! Clean flash reqiured!

    Kernel Update

    - We re-enabled MMC_CAP_ERASE on our kernel source because of following reasons:
      - "moviNAND VHX 4.41 DISCARD feature" is (and always was) added to our kernel which should prevent MAG2GA eMMC (used on most 16GB Tab2 devices) from damage (official Samsung patch)
      - even with MMC_CAP_ERASE disabled some Tab2 with MAG2GA eMMC got read only (the reason is an issue in the eMMC firmware - besides MAG2GA eMMC is faulty/bad by default)
      - without TRIM emmc lifetime is shorter, it's now possible again on supported eMMC
    - Updated P51XX Touch Firmware

    What Roms include those changes?

    - all builds and recoveries since 24.09.2016

    **NOTE:** You might need to use TWRP 3.0.2-6 (uploaded already) to flash the new roms, on Android 4 and 6 old recoveries might work (but better update too).

    - Support eMMC 4.5. In the past our "new" kernel did not support eMMC 4.5 (some people seem to have newer EMMC). On TWRP it wasn't possible to wipe or flash any files on devices with newer EMMC.

    CM 13 update for espressowifi and espresso3g

    - Support eMMC 4.5. In the past our "new" kernel did not support eMMC 4.5 (some people seem to have newer EMMC) - that's why some people haven't been able to boot latest builds and got a black screen only.

    Notes about latest official CM11 nightly update

    - Clean flash might be required because of the following changes:
      - a lot of device specific updates (e.g. a lot of OpenSource blobs we already use on Android 5.1 and newer)
      - kernel source got replaced with our omap based OpenSource kernel (full change history, a lot debloated)
    - There might be a tiny delay between the Samsung logo and the bootanimation. This happens because we disabled the bootloader init (The bootloader init was disabled and the kernel resets everything on boot which is a good thing but delays bootup). Also your Tab 2 variant get detected by the kernel automatically (read out from bootloader).
    - If you have issues to boot your tab after a clean flash, you might need to update your bootloader. I'll provide the files and a tutorial sometimes later this week (maybe next week).

    Multi-Rom Updates for espressowifi and espresso3g

    - Slim6 alpha 0.4
    - SlimLP
    - CM 13.0
    - CM 12.1
    - Omni 5.1  
    
        What changed?

      - latest Rom sources
      - device tree cleanup and reorganisation inside the device tree
      - Some Kernel changes (clean up the display init sequence without bootloader init)
      - Enable dexpreopt with PIC  
        (Our system partitions are relatively large (~1 GB), but our data partitions are relatively small (~4.6 GB on 8 GB variants).  
        In this case, it makes sense to enable WITH_DEXPREOPT_PIC, saving at least 100 MB space on our data partitions.)

    Note: Omni6 is official now! You can use official nightly builds now!

    Initial OmniRom 6.0.1 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g available

    - Latest official OmniRom source. Device specific changes are all visisble in OmniRoms device repos.
    - Currently sensor position isn't set properly on P31xx devices, but it will be fixed on upcoming builds.  
      A temporary fix can be found [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=67475381&postcount=8), you simply need to flash it after the Rom from TWRP.
    - Please note that OmniRom isn't pre-rooted!
    - Chromecast should still work on Omni 6.

    New CM 13.0 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g available

    - Latest CM 13.0 source
    - Attempt to fix hotspot
    - Ziyan fixed the random mac adress:  
      The Samsung BCMDHD used to read the factory MAC address from /efs. Accessing the filesystem in-kernel is a very bad practice, but what can we expect from Samsung?  
      We now calculate the MAC address based on the SoC Die ID: this is unique for all devices, and ensures that the same device will always have the same MAC address, not a randomly generated one.

    New CM 13.0 builds for espressowifi and espresso3g available

    - Latest CM 13.0 source
    - Clean flash recommand because we switched to our new kernel for a final public test before it finally replaces our old, bloated kernel.
    - **NOTE:** Booting takes some more time now - there's a delay for up to 10 sec. betweeen the samsung logo and bootanimation (The bootloader init was disabled and the kernel resets everything on boot which is a good thing but delays bootup.)
    - Many thanks to XDA's Ziyan for the new kernel! He did the main part of it! (We worked together on it for almost 9 months now - where is the time?!)
    - Kernel source will be available on CM's github after this public test to be sure everything works as it should - please respect that the source won't be public before
    - Found a bug? Attach a logcat and dmesg on XDA.

    New CM 13 builds available.

    Missed to add "espresso: fade off by default: This fixes orientation glitch on screen-off animation for 7 inch Tab2" - will be fixed on next build.

    - libsensors: fix possible null pointer crash
    - espresso: set hwrotation on init for 7 inch Tab2 variants
    - some updates on kernel commonisation (might fix charging on P5113).

    Those Tab2 user who are on "espresso-TWRP" please flash the latest device specific TWRP for your device or use the new Common TWRP to flash latest Roms.

    - the "espresso-TWRP" won't be able to flash Roms compiled after 22.03.2016,
    - the new "Common TWRP" won't be able to flash Roms compiled before 22.03.2017.
    I am sorry if it confuses some of you, but as i mentioned on 22.03.2016 we would conflict with HTC's "espresso" device if we don't do the renaming.
