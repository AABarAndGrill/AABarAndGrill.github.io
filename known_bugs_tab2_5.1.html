    <p><b>General Android 5.1 bugs</b></p>
    <ul>
      <p>Audio stuttering on some games:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To fix it you will have to use a root explorer and delete system/etc/permissions/android.hardware.audio.low_latency.xml (well, this isn't a proper fix but a good workaround until it is fixed properly</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p><b>CyanogenMod 12.1</b></p>
    <ul>
      <p>Chromecast not working</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no fix for it at the moment, something CyanogenMod merged broke it (works fine on Omni 5.1 and AOSP 5.1)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p><b>OmniRom 5.1</b></p>
