		<h4>Important notes for Android 6.0:</h4>
		Installing GApps tends to be problematic: in order to try to avoid installation issues, be sure to install GApps immediately after installing the ROM, before booting the system for the first time.
		<br/>
		<b>Maybe needed (check the gapps xda thread for more information):</b> After the initial bootup finished, be sure to go into Settings -> Apps, and grant every permission to every Google application - most importantly, Google Play services. In the case of an upgrade you also might need to re-install the GApps package, as upgrading wipes /system. You shouldn't need to re-set the permissions afterwards.
		<br/>
		<b>One more note:</b> DO NOT set up your Google account until you grant all permissions, otherwise you will be stuck on the initial setup.
